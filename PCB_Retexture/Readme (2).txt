===Touhou Perfect Cherry Blossom Retexture patch V3.0 by Gastari===

I basically tried to improve PCB's textures with the help of newer games

==How to install ?==

-Just replace your "th07e.dat" (if you're using english patch) or "th07.dat" (if you're using the japanese version) located inside your game folder
-Don't forget to backup your original game

==For japanese version only==
-Since this patch was made using the english patched game your game will be partially translated to english after you installed the patch.
-I'll made a real japanese version later

==Changelog==
-V1.0 : First release
-v1.1 : The layout has been changed
-V2.0 : The whole font has been changed. Some minor changes on names and spell cards
-V2.5 : New sprites for characters as well as some other changes in stage's title and difficulty select screen. Fixing some glitches
-V3.0 : Fixed a few things in the menus and some improvements in stage 2

==Thanks==
-Big thanks to Zang3tsU who helped me a lot for V2.5


===Important stuff===
-Some backgrounds are just some fanarts I found in my picture folder, I don't remember the name of any artists. If you're one of the artist and don't want your fanart to be in the patch contact me on twitch (Gastari) and I'll remove it or I'll give credits in this readme.
-Some sprites were directly taken from the thcrap PCB english patch since they fitted perfectly, if you own those sprites and wants me to remove them please contact me on twitch and I'll remove them or give credits.
