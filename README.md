# thcrap_mods

Modifications for use with the [Touhou Community Reliant Auto Patcher](https://www.thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center:Download), because I keep making them.

## Complaints

I think GitHub emails me if you make an issue, so you can do that if you really want. I also lurk on the [Touhou Patch Center Discord](https://github.com/thpatch), which may be quicker or less formal depending on your needs.

# chipin

Chipmusic Mod for Touhou Eiyashou ~ Imperishable Night, featuring 21 *different* tunes and a new script for the Barrier Team which is hopefully funny and enjoyable. Intended as a showcase for the capabilities of the BGM modification module of thcrap and the process needed to use it optimally.

Music included is all freely available online - I did my best to avoid choosing tracks which are only available on paid releases. If you want to adjust the loop points, I have also included the loop points I used with pcutmp3 to create the actual files.

# chipin_base

Base files for chipin, including the new script and images. Best practice is to separate these from audio files in the event that lossless files are available for redistribution.
